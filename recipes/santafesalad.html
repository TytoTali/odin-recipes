        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Refreshing and hearty at the same time, this Santa Fe area inspired salad is the perfect dish for a summer lunch or dinner! Season your chicken with wonderfully smokey spices to add a unique blend of flavors not found in your run-of-the-mill salad. Tomatoes, corn, avocado and crunchy tortilla strips create a satisfying mouth feel with each bite. And just you wait until you try the absolutely creamy and zingy dressing that's so easy to make.</p>
            <p>Make the chicken and dressing ahead of time, and perhaps in bulk, so you can just throw this recipe together. Colder chicken tends to go better with a salad anyway! The chicken and dressing can hold up in the fridge for up to a week, making this the perfect meal prep recipe.</p>
