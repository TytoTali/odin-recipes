        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 premade flatbreads; <em>any shape, but I usually use rectangular</em></li>
                <li>6 tablespoons basil pesto; <em>homemade or store bought</em></li>
                <li>1 cup grape or snacking tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 pound chicken breast</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cup mozzarella</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                <li><em>Optional;</em>fresh basil for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat a skillet with olive oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Season chicken breast with salt and pepper on both sides. Cook in skillet until an internal temperature of 165 degrees; about 6-8 minutes per side. Set aside.</li>
                <li>While the chicken cooks, cut the tomatoes into thin slices, width wise. Cut mozzarella cheese into chunks or shred.</li>
                <li>Once chicken has cooled enough to handle, cut into chunks or shred.</li>
                <li>Line a large baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and place the 2 flatbreads side-by-side on them. Divide the pesto between the two flatbreads and spread evenly.</li>
                <li>Arrange chicken pieces over the pesto covered flatbread, then sprinkle sliced tomatoes over top.</li>
                <li>Top everything with the chunked or shredded mozzarella, sprinkling it evenly.</li>
                <li>Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the edges of the flatbread are crispy. Remove from over and cut into desired slices.</li>
                <li>Top with optional garnishes, like balsamic glaze, additional olive oil, or torn basil leaves, and serve.</li>
            </ol>
